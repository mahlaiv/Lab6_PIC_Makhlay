# Scenario for using a weather API
Let’s start using an actual REST API to get more familiar with how they work. In the upcoming sections, you’ll explore some weather APIs in the context of a specific use case: retrieving a weather forecast. By first playing the role of a developer using an API, you’ll gain a greater understanding of how your audience will use APIs, the type of information they’ll need, and what they might do with the information.
# Sample scenario: How windy is it?
Let’s say that you’re a web developer and you want to add weather information to your site. Your site is for cyclists. You want to allow users who come to your site to see the current wind and temperature conditions. You don’t have your own meteorological service, so you’ll need to make some calls out to a weather service to get this information. Then you will present that information to users
# Explore the OpenWeatherMap API
Although there are many good weather API options for developers, I decided to use the OpenWeatherMap API in this course because the service is easy to use, free, and stable.
# Activity: Get familiar with the OpenWeatherMap API
Let’s explore the basic sections in the OpenWeatherMap API:

Go to the openweathermap.org.
Click API in the top navigation bar.
In the Current weather data section, click the API doc button.
Click some of the links in the Examples of API calls sections.

Get a sense of the information this Current Weather Data API provides. The API calls provide developers with ways to pull information into their applications. In other words, the APIs will provide the data plumbing for the applications that developers build.
